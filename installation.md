# Build from Source

## Which method to use

#### Requirements:

| Method                             | Operating System | Java/Maven | Vagrant/VirtualBox |
|------------------------------------|------------------|------------|--------------------|
| [Java](installation.md#Java)       | Any              | Yes        | No                 |
| [Docker](installation.md#Docker)   | Linux            | Yes        | No                 |
| [Vagrant](installation.md#Vagrant) | Any              | No         | Yes                |

#### Takeaways:

- **If you don't want to set up Java and Maven**, use the Vagrant
   method.
- **If you have Java and Maven installed** (or know how to do so), use
  the Java (on any operating system) or Docker (on Linux) build instructions.
- **If you wish to create a Docker image** (possibly for deployment to a
  production environment) follow the Docker build instructions.

#### Warnings about Java:

- If you are *not* using Linux, use Oracle JDK rather than OpenJDK.
- You **must** use Java 8 or higher. The build will fail with lower
  versions of Java.
- If you have multiple versions of Java installed, make sure your path
  points at JDK 8.

## Notes for production deployment:

- The application runs on port 8080. All methods below preserve this.
- The Vagrant method is intended for development only. If you intend
  to deploy the VM it creates to a production environment be sure to
  un-comment the `dnf update` command and apply any relevant hardening
  to the image.
- You will want to set up a reverse proxy server to provide the
  application on a standard HTTP and/or HTTPS port(s).

## [Java build](#Java)

### Pre-requisites:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Oracle Java
  8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  (JDK, not JRE) or [OpenJDK 8](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) (If
  you have other versions installed, make sure that JDK 8 is on the
  PATH)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#Installation)

### Build instructions
1. Check out the code: `git clone
   https://github.com/TFlowGit/tf-ads-bpa.git`
2. Change to the code directory: `cd tf-ads-bpa`
3. Build the application: `mvn package`

### Running the application

Start the application with the command
`java -jar openfda-web/target/openfda-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

After the app has finished starting up, browse to
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Use `Ctrl-C` to terminate the application when you are finished with
it.

For production use you will want to copy the
`openfda-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file to your server and run the
`java -jar openfda-web-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` command from an unprivileged
account.

## [Docker build](#Docker)

Note that Docker requires you to be running on a Linux system or to
use [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/). Alternatively you may use
the Vagrant build instructions provided elsewhere in this file.

### Pre-requisites:
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Oracle Java
  8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
  (JDK, not JRE) or [OpenJDK 8](http://openjdk.java.net/install/) (If
  you have other versions installed, make sure that JDK 8 is on the
  PATH)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#Installation)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) must be installed and must work
  without using `sudo`. On most distributions this means that your
  user account must be a member of the `docker` group. You may also
  need to change the file `/var/run/docker.sock` to be owned by the
  `docker` group.

### Build instructions
1. Check out the code: `git clone
   https://github.com/TFlowGit/tf-ads-bpa.git`
2. Change to the code directory: `cd tf-ads-bpa`
3. Build the application using the `docker` profile:
   `mvn -P docker package`

### Running the application

Start the application with the command
`docker run -p 8080:8080 techflow/openfda-web`

After the app has finished starting up, browse to
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Use `Ctrl-C` to terminate the application/container when you are
finished with it.

For production use you may either export the application to Docker Hub
and import to your server from there or you can export the image to a
file and import to your server.

<br/><br/>

## [Vagrant build](#Vagrant)

### Prerequisites:
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

### Build instructions:
1. Check out the code: `git clone
   https://github.com/TFlowGit/tf-ads-bpa.git`
2. Change to the code directory: `cd tf-ads-bpa`
3. Build and run the application: `vagrant up`

After it is done starting up, give it another moment to finish booting
the Tomcat server inside of Docker and browse to
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

Use `vagrant halt` to stop the VM or `vagrant destroy -f` to delete it.
